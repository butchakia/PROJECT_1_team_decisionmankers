This project focuses on the factors that predict heart attacks in adults.  To determine the factors that predict heart attacks in adults several data sets were utilized and cleaned in this project, and referenced below.  

## Questions we hope to answer in this project;

1. What is the most important factor in determining heart disease?
2. What are the highest coorelated factors for heart disease?
3. What groups are the most at risk for heart attacks?
4. What could be the most important choices made to reverse the potential negative outcoes of heart disease?
5. How will this data help hospitals to make informed decisions and develop effective business plans and strategies?

**About our Data** 

* Framingham Data<sup>1</sup>

> "The Framingham heart disease dataset includes over 4,240 records,16 columns and 15 attributes. 
The goal of the dataset is to predict whether the patient has 10-year risk of future (CHD) coronary heart disease"<sup>1</sup>

* DC Data<sup>2</sup>

**Licensing of Data**

* This specific sampling of the Framingham dataset has ambiguous licensing. The licensing when downloaded from kaggel is stated as 'unknown', full use of the Framingham dataset requires an application and approval of research.  The full data set covers a much larger dataset than the sampling we have accessed off kaggle.com.

* CDC dataset has 

**References**

<sup>1</sup> This data set dates from 1988 and consists of four databases: Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach V. It contains 76 attributes, including the predicted attribute, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. The "target" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued 0 = no disease and 1 = disease.
