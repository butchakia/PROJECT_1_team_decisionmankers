This project focuses on the factors that predict heart attacks in adults.  To determine the factors that predict heart attacks in adults several data sets were utilized and cleaned in this project, and referenced below.  

Questions we hope to answer in this project;

1. What is the most important factor in determining heart disease?
2. What are the highest coorelated factors for heart disease?
3. What groups are the most at risk for heart attacks?
4. What could be the most important choices made to reverse the potential negative outcoes of heart disease?

<sup>1</sup> This data set dates from 1988 and consists of four databases: Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach V. It contains 76 attributes, including the predicted attribute, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. The "target" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued 0 = no disease and 1 = disease.
